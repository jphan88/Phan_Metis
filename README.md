## Project 1

We received an email from WomenTechWomenYes asking our team to use the power of analytics to help optimize the effectiveness of their street teams’ promotion of their annual event gala scheduled to occur early summer. These street teams will be located near subway stations to pass out flyers to patrons where they can receive free tickets to the gala. The goal of the gala is to increase women’s interest in technology and fundraise for scholarships. 

	Objective

	Our task is to identify the optimal subway stations to place these street teams to increase attendance to the gala and maximize the likelihood of donations to the organization.

Assumptions

There are a couple of assumptions we made before proceeding to our analysis. We assumed the gala event would occur in mid June of 2018. Therefore it made the most sense to analyze the MTA data three months prior to the event.  We decided to analyze data from March through the first week of June and went back to 2015 to further increase the accuracy of the statistics.  In addition we are assuming the street teams are able to cover 10 stations.
