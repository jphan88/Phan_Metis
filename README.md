## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/jphan88/Phan_Metis/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

It’s the first week of Metis and we are starting  it off on a Tuesday due to Martin Luther King’s holiday. Although so many other people (not in the bootcamp) are rejoicing for the day off, I know what this really means… We will have to cram five days of  material into four and have one less day to work on our project which is still due on the same Friday. As expected the first week started as intense as I expected and the shorter time span made this even more so.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jphan88/Phan_Metis/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
